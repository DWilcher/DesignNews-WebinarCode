The code posted is in C++ and Python formats. The course materials provide information on executing the Tiny ML and TensorFlow applications using the two programming methods. Use the following steps to install the TensorFlow Lite folder with the examples onto your development machine.
  1. Go to the following link to download the version of the library the tutorial's sketches were written for:
     https://downloads.arduino.cc/libraries/github.com/bcmi-labs/Arduino_TensorFlowLite-2.4.0-ALPHA.zip
  2. Wait for the download to be finished.
  3. Select Sketch > Include library > Add .ZIP Library from the Arduino IDE menus.
  4. Select the downloaded file.
  5. Click the Open button.
In addition to the installation directions, add the appropriate sensor libraries to ensure the code is in alignment with the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense revision 2 board. The old sensors should be removed from the "including" statements and replaced with the newly installed Nano 33 BLE Sense board sensors header files ".h".
Run the code examples provided in the .zipped Days folder for proper compilation results.

Day 4 Code: Fruit To Emoji Application
Here are the steps to successfully run the Fruit To Emoji ML Application
   1. Look into the FruitToEmoji folder.
   2. Open the sketches folder.
   3. Open the object_color_capture code
      a) compile and upload the code to the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense board using the IDE.
      b) Color data of target fruit will be logged using a Software Serial Monitor like Tera Term or PuTTY.
The following steps will aid in running the Parts A & B Fruit_Classifier_Python code in Google Colab.
   1. Open the object_classifier_folder.
   2. Parts A & B Fruit_Classifier_Python code will be found in this folder.
   3. Open each file in a separate Code Cell in Google Colaboratory.
   4. Click the run/play button to execute the code and to see the final predictive Fruit To Emoji results from the object_color_capture code csv data.

Here are the steps to train on different fruits.
   1. Open Google Colaboratory
   2. Open the FruitToEmoji Jupyter Source file located in the FruitToEmoji folder.
   3. Follow the steps presented in the source file to train on different fruits.

This code is for the Design News CEC Robot Design: Prototyping Actuator and Drive Systems for Robots Webinar. Webinar dates: February 23 - 27, 2026. The code is for the ESP32 DC Motor and Solenoid Control Labs. The lab code is written in MicroPython. The Thonny IDE allows ease of use for testing and programming the ESP32 devkit board. The "main.py" code is used to flash the program onto the ESP32 microcontroller. The defined named MicroPython code can be executed by clicking the play button located within the Thonny IDE.
