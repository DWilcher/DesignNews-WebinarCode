This code is for the Design News CEC Getting in Tiny ML With Arduino. Webinar dates: December 15-19, 2025. The code is for the 5 lab projects exploring various TensorFlow and Tiny ML models. The code posted is in C++ and Python formats. The course materials provides information on executing the Tiny ML and TensorFlow applications using the two programming methods. Use the following steps intstall the TensorFlow Lite folder with the examples on to your development machine.
  1. Go to the following link to download the version of the library the tutorial's sketches were written for:
     https://downloads.arduino.cc/libraries/github.com/bcmi-labs/Arduino_TensorFlowLite-2.4.0-ALPHA.zip
  2. Wait for the download to finish.
  3. Select Sketch > Include library > Add .ZIP Library from the Arduino IDE menus.
  4. Select the downloaded file.
  5. Click the Open button.
In addition to the installation direction, add the appropriate sensor libraries to insure the code is in alignment with the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense revision 2 board. The old sensors should be removed from the "include" statements and replaced with the newly installed Nano 33 BLE Sense board sensors.
Run the code examples provided in the .zipped Days folder for proper compilation results.
